## TASK
Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money x using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are {1,5,7} and the desired sum is 11, an optimal solution is 5+5+1 which requires 3 coins.
## Constraints
    - 1≤n≤100 
    - 1≤x≤106
    - 1≤ci≤106
## Example:
### Input
The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has n distinct integers c1,c2,…,cn: the value of each coin.

Example Input:- 
3 11
1 5 7
### Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to produce the desired sum, print −1.
Example Output:- 
3
