Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.


example 1
```
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
Output:
9
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is 9
of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
is a contiguous subarray.
```
example 2
```
Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is -1 
of element (-1)
